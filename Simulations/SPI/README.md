# Simulation of the SPI interface

This is the files for the SPI simulation. The simulation is done using ModelSim and the [UVVM](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM_Light) framework.

## Simulation Goals

The goal of this simulation is to verify the functionality of the SPI interface and that it outputs the correct data when it should.

### Test Cases
