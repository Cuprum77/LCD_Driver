# EDID data

This is the EDID data for the display module.
It contains the display's capabilities and is used by the host to determine the display's capabilities as well as if it is connected.
The EDID data is generated using the (DeltaCast EDID tool)[https://www.deltacast.tv/products/free-software/e-edid-editor] found mentioned in an Adafruit tutorial during my research.
Note, that tool requires name and email to download!
