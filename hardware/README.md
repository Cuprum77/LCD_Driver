This repo contains the KiCAD files for the current hardware prototypes of the LCD driver board.

## Current version

The latest board manufactured is the [Breakout_1](Breakout_1/) board. This PCB is a breakout board for the LCD display, which allows for easy testing and verification of the display. It also contains a 40 pin header for the LCD display itself and a PMOD interface for hooking up with a FPGA board.
